            No -- to get the most out of the course, you should prepare
            questions ahead of each lecture and seminar and bring any topics
            you&#39;d like to discuss, but there won&#39;t be any formal
            homework or assignments.

          Why are we charging money?
        </h2>
        <div className='tracking-wide w-100 text-gray-800'>
          <p>
            We want to continue building Campuswire Coures and offer more great
            classes in the future -- to do that, we&#39;ve got to charge money
            for courses so we can continue building.
          </p>
          <p className='py-4'>
            The tuition fee also helps us give back. We&#39;re donating 25% of
            proceeds from the course to BLCK VC (https://www.blckvc.com/) to
            increase Black representation in the investing world.

          Why do we have two pricing tiers?
        </h2>
        <div className='tracking-wide w-100 text-gray-800'>
          <p>
            Accessibility is important to us -- we want to make sure our course
            is accessible to as many students.

          <p className='py-4'>
            Charging a higher price for established angel investors and for
            experienced professionals looking to move into angel investing helps
            us offer a lower price to future and up-and-coming investors who
            wouldn&#39;t have access at a higher price.
